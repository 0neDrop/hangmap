## How We Use Your Information

### To Provide and Improve Our Services
We use your data to verify your identity and enable you to access HangMap. We provide personalized recommendations for places and group suggestions based on your interests and location data. We analyze user habits and behaviors within a location radius to improve our services and user experience. This includes using your data to refine our algorithms, conduct user research, and develop new features.

### For Analytics and Research
We analyze how users interact with the App, including how weather, time, and specific areas affect app usage and activity levels. This helps us train machine learning algorithms with swipe data for improving recommendations.

### For Personalized Advertising
We deliver personalized advertising and marketing messages through services like Google AdMob.

### For Safety and Security
We provide safety notifications to designated contacts if you leave a predefined safety radius or do not respond to check-ins. We report and share information with law enforcement in cases of illegal activities or content.

## Data Sharing

### With Third-Party Service Providers
We share data with third-party service providers like Google AdMob for advertising and Apple Pay and Stripe for payment processing. We may use third-party APIs for services like authentication via Google, Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat.

### With Law Enforcement
We may share information with law enforcement agencies if required by law or in response to legal requests, particularly in cases involving illegal content or activities.

### With Partners
We may share anonymized or aggregated data with partners for research, analysis, or other business purposes.

### Business Transfers
In the event of a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your information may be transferred. We will notify you of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.

## Data Security

### Measures Taken
We use industry-standard encryption and security measures to protect your data, including MongoDB Atlas for data storage. Sensitive information, such as passwords and payment details, is encrypted to protect your data.

## User Rights

### Access and Update
Users can access and update their information by logging into their account and interacting with the App. Users can delete their information by deleting their account, though some data may be retained for legal reasons.

### Deletion and Retention
We retain data necessary for legal issues and industry-standard requirements. Non-essential data, such as old swipe data, is deleted when no longer relevant.

## Retention of Information

### Retention Periods
We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Specific retention periods are determined based on legal requirements, the nature of the data, and the purpose for which it was collected.

## International Data Transfers

Data may be transferred internationally within our CDN or company, but only for internal use and not shared with external parties unless related to advertising or third-party APIs.

## Communication with Users

### Policy Updates
Users will be informed about changes to the Privacy Policy via email (if provided) and through an app notification at startup, which requires user agreement before dismissal.

## Legal Compliance

### Regulatory Compliance
HangMap complies with U.S. privacy laws, including COPPA, ensuring only users aged 13 and up can access the App. The App employs an AI system to flag potentially underage users and prevent intermixing between users under 18 and above 18.
